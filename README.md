12.   Having   seen   the   quantity   of   drugs   supplied   by   pharmaceutical   companies   in   a   competitive   market,   a
government decides to force companies to sell exactly the   same   quantity   of   drugs   at   prevailing   market prices.   The government then forbids additional drug sales   and   allows   doctors   to   prescribe   the   drugs   at no   cost   to patients   in   need.    This   government   scheme   is

B)   efficient   as   consumer   surplus   is   maximized.
C)   likely   to   be   inefficient   as   doctors   are   unlikely   to   prescribe   drugs   to   the   consumers   who   are   willing   to   pay the   most   for   the   drugs.
D)   likely   to   be   inefficient   as   drug   producers   have   a   captive   buyer.
E)   efficient   as   the   price   of   drugs   paid   by   the   government   is   the   same   as   under   a   free   market.
