24)   The   expected   value   is   a   measure   of:
A)   uncertainty.                                                                         B)   central   tendency.                                                 C)   variability.                                                                            D)   risk.
25)   Blanca   would   prefer   a   certain   income   of   $20,000   to   a   gamble   with   a   0.5   probability   of   $10,000   and   a   0.5   probability   of   $30,000.    Based   on   this   information:
A)   we   can   infer   that   Blanca   neutral.                                                                                                                            B) we   can   infer   that   Blanca   is   risk   loving.
C)   we   can   infer   that   Blanca   is   risk   averse.                                                                                           D)   we   cannot   infer   Blanca's   risk   preferences.

26) When   facing   a   50% chance   of   receiving   $50   and   a   50%   chance   of   receiving   $100,   the   individual   pictured   in Figure   5.2.2:
A)   would   want   to   be   paid   a   risk   premium   of   10 utils   to   give   up   the   opportunity   of   facing   the   two   outcomes.
B) would   pay   a   risk   premium   of   10 utils   to   avoid   facing   the   two   outcomes.
C)   would   want   to   be   paid   a   risk   premium   of   $7.50 to   avoid   facing   the   two   outcomes.
D)   would   pay   a   risk   premium   of   $7.50 to   avoid   facing   the   two   outcomes.
E) has   a   risk   premium   of   10 utils.
Scenario   5.8:
Risk-neutral   Icarus   Airlines   must   commit   now   to   leasing   1, 2,   or   3 new   airplanes.   It   knows   with   certainty   that   on   the   basis   of    business   travel   alone, it   will   need   at   least   1 airplane.      The   marketing   division   says   that   there   is   a   50%   chance   that   tourism   will   be   big   enough   for   a   second   plane   only.    Otherwise,   tourism   will   be   big   enough   for   a   third   plane.      This,   plus   revenue information, yields the following table:

$10 million                              $140   millionProfit       $60 million $75 million
27)   Refer   to   Scenario   5.8.    Given   that   the   two   outcomes   are   equally   likely,   Icarus   Airlines'   expected   profit   under complete information would be:
A)   $120 million.
B)   $40 million.
C)   $90 million.
D)   $125 million.
E)   $115 million.
28) We   may   not   be   able   to   fully   remove   risk   by   diversification   if:
A) buying   stock   on   margin   is   not   allowed   by   financial   regulators.
B)   a   completely   risk-free   asset   does   not   exist.
C)   the   asset   returns   in   our   portfolio   are   positively   correlated.
D)   none   of   the   above


29)   Suppose   our   firm   produces   chartered   business   flights   with   capital   (planes)   and   labor   (pilots)   in   fixed   proportion (i.e., one   pilot   for   each   plane).    The   expansion   path   for   this   business   will:
A) not   be   defined.
B) be   a   vertical   line.
C)   follow   the   45-degree   line   from   the   origin.
D)   increase   at   a   decreasing   rate   because   we   will   substitute   capital   for   labor   as   the   business   grow.
30) Davy   Metal   Company   produces   brass   fittings.   
                                       Q =   500L0.6K0.8,
where   Q   = annual   output   measured   in   pounds, L   = labor   measured   in   person   hours,   K   = capital   measured   in machine   hours. The   marginal   products   of   labor   and   capital   are:
MPL   = 300L-0.4K0.8                     MP   K   = 400L0.6K-0.2
Davy's   employees   are   relatively   highly   skilled   and   earn   $15   per   hour.   The   firm   estimates   a   rental   charge   of   $50   per hour on capital.    Determine the firm's optimal capital-labor ratio,   given   the information   above.
