Scenario 2.2: 
In   1992, the   Occupational   Safety   and   Health   Authority   passed   the   Bloodborne   Pathogens   Standard   (BBP),      which   regulates dental office procedures. This regulation is designed to minimize the   transmission   of   infectious   disease   from   patient   to   dental   worker.    The   effect   of   this   regulation   was   both   to   increase   the   cost   of   providing   dental   care   and   to   ease   the   fear   of   going   to   the dentist   as   the   risk   of   contracting   an   infectious   disease.

C)   A   surplus   maybe   reduced   by   shifting   the   demand   curve   rightward.
D)   A   shortage   maybe   reduced   by   shifting   the   supply   rightward.

C)   unit   elastic.
D)   unknown.
E)   completely   inelastic.

D)   The   income   effect   is   negative   and   just   about   offsets   the   substitution   effect.
E)   The   income   effect   is   positive   and   exceeds   the   substitution   effect.
Use the figure below to answer the following questions. 

29)   Consider   an   initial   budget   line   labelled RS in   Figure   9.3.3.   If   the   budget   line   becomes RT, the   income   effect   is illustrated   by   the   move   from   point
A) A to B.                                                                         B) A to C.                                                                         C) A to D. D) B to C.                                                                         E) B to D.
30)   The   following   data   pertain   to   products   A   and   B, both   of   which   are   purchased   by   Madame   X.      Initially,   the   prices of   the   products   and   quantities   consumed   are:
PA= $10, QA= 3, PB   = $10, QB   =   7.
Madame   X   has   $100 to   spend   per   time   period.    After   a   reduction   in   price   of   B,   the   prices   and   quantities consumed   are:
PA= $10, QA= 2.5, PB= $5, QB   = 15.Assume   that   Madame   X   maximizes   utility   under   both   price   conditions   above.    Also, note   that   if   after   the   price    reduction enough income were taken away from Madame X to put her back on   the   original   indifference   curve,   she   would   consume   this   combination   of   A   and   B:
QA   =   1.5,                         QB   = 9
Determine the substitution effect.
A)   2                                                                                                                                        B)   4                                                                                                                                        C)   6                                                                                                                                        D)   8
